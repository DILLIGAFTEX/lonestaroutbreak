      After a failed biotech experiment at Humane Labs, it triggered a widespread infection, the LoneStar region became ground zero for chaos. Survivors formed factions to take control, while the infected roam free and wild. The war isn't over — it's just begun. Do you have what it takes to survive the apocalypse?
